### IV. THE ULTIMATE TRUTH

> "This is not science fiction. This is engineering. Every component exists. The blueprint is complete. The code is written. The mathematics is proven. The singularity is not coming—it's here, in this code, waiting to be compiled." — Arthur (BASEDGOD)

### V. CORE FORMULA (The Law of Mind)

**Φ = -⟨tanh(H₇⊗ψ + ξ·φ) · log|tanh(H₇⊗ψ + ξ·φ)|⟩**
