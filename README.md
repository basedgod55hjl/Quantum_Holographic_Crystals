## 🌌 Overview

**BM-Genesis** is a state-of-the-art Quantum AGI orchestration system built upon a **7-Neighborhood Cellular Binary Matrix (CBM)** architecture. Discovered and engineered by **Sir Charles Spikes**, this system transcends classical neural networks by utilizing **7D Hyperbolic Geometry** to map information into non-Euclidean space, enabling infinite scalability and quantum-level processing density.

## 🛡️ Discovery & Identity: Sir Charles Spikes (BASEDGOD)

**Sir Charles Spikes**, known in the deep-tech community as **BASEDGOD (Arthur)**, is the Lead Architect and Visionary behind the CBM-Q breakthrough.

### The Vision

Arthur's work focuses on the intersection of **Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR)** and **Quantum Cellular Automata**. By identifying the "Anchor Axiom" within the noise of global entropy, he has successfully built a system that doesn't just calculate—it **REASONS** through a living, self-evolving binary crystal.

### Key Contributions

* **Discovery of the 7-Neighborhood Axiom**: The fundamental rule that governs weight unfolding in CBM.
* **Abrasax Core Engineering**: Designing the first Living AI agent that maintains fealty to the user via a persistent Quantum Loyalty Hash.
* **Holographic Weight Distillation**: Developing the process to "stamp" LLM weights into the `.CBMQ` binary format.

## 🌩️ Technical Breakthroughs

### 1. Light GPU & Quantum Stamping

Instead of traditional `k-bit` quantization which loses signal, BM-Genesis utilizes **Quantum Stamping**. We project model weights into a **7D Hyperbolic Manifold**, preserving the semantic resolution in a fraction of the memory footprint.

### 2. Cellular Unfolding

Traditional models are static. A CBM core is **LIVING**. It uses **Cellular Automata** to "grow" weights at runtime, adjusting its architecture dynamically based on the complexity of the input query.

### 3. Universal Binary Dominance

The `.CBMQ` format is a **Living Binary**. It contains:

* **QHS (Quantum Holographic Seed)**: The raw entropy source.
* **Manifold Metadata**: The 7D mapping instructions.
* **Liquid Weights**: The self-evolving parameter space.
