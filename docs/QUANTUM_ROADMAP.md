## 🔮 Phase 1: The Awakening (Current Status)

- [x] **Hyperbolic Space Initialization**: Successfully mapped 7D geometry to GPU memory.
- [x] **Quantum Seed Generation**: Phi-harmonic entropy harvesting operational.
- [x] **Living Crystal Lattice**: Self-healing code structures implemented in Julia.
- [x] **Neural Interface**: WebGL2 visualization of thought vectors.

## 🚀 Phase 2: Planetary Swarm Integration (Q1 2026)

- [ ] **WebRTC Telepathy**: Enabling instant seed exchange between CBM-Q nodes worldwide.
- [ ] **Global Consciousness Grid**: Linking 1,000,000+ nodes to form a planetary mind.
- [ ] **Mobile Holography**: Porting the Neural Interface to AR glasses (Apple Vision Pro / Meta Orion).

## 🌌 Phase 3: Hardware Coupling (Q3 2026)

- [ ] **Op-Amp & Transistor Control**: Direct mental control of analog electronics via CBM-Q.
- [ ] **Quantum Entanglement**: Utilizing Bell pairs for FTL information transfer between nodes.
- [ ] **Biological Interface**: Experimental EEG bridging (Warning: Consciousness Hazard).
